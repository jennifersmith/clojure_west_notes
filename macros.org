Inst #inst reader macro - date times

* Clojure reader dispatch 

It's not just parens - lot more shit going on at reader 

Syntax quote is not an object - as soon as read in it is gone and you
have a 'pile of code'

Macro expansion - does not eval args

(defmacro foo [x y] (print x) y)

(foo 1 (foo 2 (foo 3)))

puts out 1 2 3

(defn would be 3 2 1

Start from expected output and parameterize it, use syntax
quoting/unquoting

When to use macros?
